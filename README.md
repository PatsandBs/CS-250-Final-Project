How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs are determined from the user themselves either from user focus groups or determined from the needs of the clients/stakeholders. The user stories are then deciphered from those user needs and specific tasks are created that'll help accomplish and achieve those needs.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The agile practices that have the most positive effect on producing quality work is keeping constant communication with the client to complete continuous improvement through every stage. Teams cycle through stages of planning, executing, and then evaluating that work after each sprint.


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development contributes quality work to the team. They do their job and are accountable for the work they produce. This keeps everyone on the team honest with open communication.
